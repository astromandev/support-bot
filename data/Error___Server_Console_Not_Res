Error: Error: "Server Console Not Responding" On Pterodactyl Panel.

Solution: 1. Log in to your Pterodactyl panel, navigate to your server dashboard, and click on the "Console" tab.
2. Check if the console screen shows any ongoing processes or scripts. If it is, wait for it to finish as it may take some time, especially during server startup.
3. If there is no ongoing process, try refreshing the console by closing and reopening it.
