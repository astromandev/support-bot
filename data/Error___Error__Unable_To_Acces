Error: Error: "Error: Unable To Access Jarfile Server.Jar" When Trying To Start A Minecraft Server Through The Pterodactyl Panel.

Solution: 1. Login to your Pterodactyl panel.
2. Go to your server's "Startup" tab.
3. Under "Startup Command," make sure that the command is set to "java -jar server.jar".
4. If the command is already set to "java -jar server.jar", try redownloading the server.jar
