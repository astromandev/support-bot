Error: Error: "Connection Refused" When Trying To Connect To The Pterodactyl Panel

Solution: 1. Check your internet connection to ensure that it is stable and working properly.
2. Verify that the Pterodactyl panel server is running and listening on the correct port. You can do this by checking the panel logs or by running the command "netstat -tulpn | grep LISTEN" on the server terminal to see if the panel is listening on the correct port.
