Error: Error: "The Server Won'T Start After Updating Plugins Through The Pterodactyl Panel"

Solution: 1. Before updating any plugin, ensure that you have a backup of your server files, including the World folder and configuration files. This will help you to easily roll back to the previous version in case anything goes wrong during the update process.

2. Check the plugin version and compatibility with the Minecraft server version. Ensure that you are installing the right plugin version for your Minecraft server.
