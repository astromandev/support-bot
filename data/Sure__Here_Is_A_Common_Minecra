Error: Sure, Here Is A Common Minecraft Server Error And Its Solution:

Error: "Failed To Bind To Port"

Solution: 1. This error occurs when the port your server is trying to use is already being used by another program. You need to change the port number for your server to use.

2. Open your server.properties file (located in your Minecraft server folder) with a text editor like Notepad.

3. Locate the "server-port" line and change the number to an available port.
