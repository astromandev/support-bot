Error: Error: "The Panel Is Not Showing The Correct Status For My Minecraft Server"

Solution: 1. Open the Pterodactyl panel and navigate to your server's dashboard.
2. Check if the server's console is displaying any error messages or if there are any issues with the server's startup. If there are, try to fix those issues first.
3. If there are no obvious issues with the server's startup, check whether the server is actually online by using the server's IP address
