Error: Error:
"An Error Occurred While Trying To Create A New Pterodactyl Panel Minecraft Server. The System Returned An Error Message Saying There Is Not Enough Disk Space Available To Create The Server."

Solution: 1. Log in to your server via SSH or SFTP. You can use an FTP client or an SSH client, like PuTTY, to connect.

2. Check the disk space on your server. You can use the "df" command in your shell to check your disk usage.
