Error: Error: "Server Not Starting Due To Missing Or Invalid Java Installation."

Solution: 1. Check if the Java installation is present on your server. Run the command `java -version` to check if Java is installed. 

2. If Java is not installed, install Java on your server. You can install Java using the following command: 

```
sudo apt-get install default-jre
```

3. Once Java is installed, check the Java version again by running `java -version`.
