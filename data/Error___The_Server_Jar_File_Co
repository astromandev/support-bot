Error: Error: "The Server Jar File Could Not Be Found In The Specified Directory"

Solution: 1. Log in to your Pterodactyl panel and navigate to the "File Manager" page.
2. Check if the server jar file exists in the specified directory or not. If not, upload the server jar file to the directory where it should be located.
3. If the server jar file exists, double-check the file name and make sure it matches the name specified in the startup command.
