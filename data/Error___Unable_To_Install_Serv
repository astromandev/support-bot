Error: Error: "Unable To Install Server Jar. Please Contact Support For Assistance."

Solution: 1. Check if the server jar file is properly uploaded to the panel. If not, upload the file again and try to install it.
2. Make sure that the java version of your server matches with the server jar file. If your server is running on Java 14, then use a server jar file that is optimized for Java 14.
3. Try to delete the existing server and create a new one
