Error: Error: "The Server Panel Is Unable To Create A New Minecraft Server Instance"

Solution: 1. Check the available disk space on the server. Make sure that there is enough free space for the new server instance.

2. Verify that the server's main process is running. If the process is not running, restart it.

3. Make sure that the server allocation limits assigned to the panel are sufficient. If allocation limits are too low, the panel will be unable to create more server instances.
