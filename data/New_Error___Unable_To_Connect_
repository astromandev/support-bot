Error: New Error: "Unable To Connect To The Server - Authentication Servers Are Down For Maintenance"

Solution: 1. Check the official Minecraft Twitter account or website to verify if the authentication servers are actually down for maintenance.
2. If the servers are down, there's nothing you can do but wait until they are up again. You can check the official Minecraft Twitter account for updates on when they will be back online.
3. If the servers are not down, then the issue might be with your internet connection
