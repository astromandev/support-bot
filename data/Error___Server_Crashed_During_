Error: Error: "Server Crashed During Start Up"

Solution: 1. Log into the Pterodactyl panel and navigate to the "Console" tab for the affected server.
2. Look for any error messages related to the crash. A common cause of server crashes is a lack of available memory. Check to see if the server is maxing out its allocated RAM.
3. Try increasing the server's RAM allocation in the "Configuration" tab, by adjusting the "Server Memory" field value
