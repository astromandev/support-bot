Error: Error: "Unable To Connect To Websocket At Ws://<Server IP>:8080/Socket/Websocket"

Solution: 1. Make sure that the server has been started and is running correctly. If not, start it.
2. Check to make sure that the server's IP address is correct.
3. Check to ensure that the websocket is enabled in the Pterodactyl Panel. To do this, login to the panel, then click on "Servers" and select the server in question.
