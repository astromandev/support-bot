Error: Error: "Server Cannot Be Started Due To Missing Or Corrupted Java Installation"

Solution: Step 1: Check if Java is installed on your system and its version. Open Command Prompt or Terminal and run the following command:
```
java -version
```
If the output shows that Java is not installed, download and install the latest version from the official website.

Step 2: If Java is installed but the error persists, check the environment variables. On Windows, search for "Environment Variables"
