Error: Error: "Server Marked As Crashed And Doesn'T Stay Up" When Starting A Minecraft Server On The Pterodactyl Control Panel.

Solution: 1. Log into the Pterodactyl control panel and navigate to the "Server Startup" tab.
2. Locate the "Startup Command" field and ensure it is set to the correct command. The command for starting a vanilla Minecraft server should be:
java -Xms1G -Xmx1G -jar server.jar nogui
