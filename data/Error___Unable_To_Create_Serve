Error: Error: "Unable To Create Server - The Server Name Is Already In Use"

Solution: 1. Check whether a server with the same name already exists in the panel or not.
2. If the server already exists, then try renaming or deleting it to free up the name.
3. If the server does not exist or you have renamed/deleted it already, then check whether any residual files or directories of the previous server are present on your system.
4. If any residual files or directories exist
