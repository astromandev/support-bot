Error: Error: "Unable To Allocate X Amount Of Memory"

Solution: 1. First, check how much RAM your server has by going to the "Server Configuration" tab in the Pterodactyl panel.
2. Next, check how much RAM you have allocated to your Minecraft server by going to the "Startup" tab in the Pterodactyl panel.
3. If you don't have enough RAM allocated, increase the amount by editing the value under the "JVM Arguments" section
