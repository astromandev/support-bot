Error: Error: "Java Is Not Recognized As An Internal Or External Command, Operable Program Or Batch File" When Starting A Minecraft Server On Pterodactyl Panel

Solution: 1. Log in to the Pterodactyl panel and open the console of the server.
2. Type "java -version" to see if Java is installed on your server. If Java is not installed, you need to install Java runtime environment (JRE) or Java development kit (JDK).
