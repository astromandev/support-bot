Error: Error: "Unable To Open JAR File: Java.Nio.File.AccessDeniedException: [Server.Jar]" When Trying To Start The Server On Pterodactyl Panel.

Solution: 1. First, make sure that the server jar file exists in the correct directory. If it is not there, upload it to the server using the file manager.

2. Check the file permissions of the jar file. Make sure that the user running the server has the necessary permissions to read and execute the file.
