Error: Error: "Failed To Load Resource: The Server Responded With A Status Of 403 (Forbidden)" On Pterodactyl Panel While Trying To Upload A Minecraft World.

Solution: 1. Firstly, check if the file size of the Minecraft world does not exceed the maximum storage limit set for the server's disk space.

2. Next, ensure that the file permissions for the Minecraft world are set correctly. You may use the FTP client in the Pterodactyl panel to do so.
