Error: "The Server Does Not Start Even Though All The Configuration Settings Are Correct."

Solution: 1. Check the "Startup Command" section of the server settings to make sure it is set up correctly.
2. If the startup command looks fine, try creating a new server instance to see if that resolves the issue.
3. Check the server logs for any error messages or warnings that may indicate the problem.
