Error: Error: "Failed To Create A Minecraft Server Using The Pterodactyl Panel"

Solution: 1. Check that you have allocated enough RAM to your server. To do this, log in to your Pterodactyl panel and go to the "Console" tab. Type the command "free -m" (without quotes) to check your RAM allocation.

2. Make sure that you have the correct version of Java installed on your server. Update to the latest version if necessary.
