Error: Error: "Server Error: Failed To Bind To Address Tcp://0.0.0.0:25565: Address Already In Use"

Solution: This error occurs when the server is unable to bind to the default Minecraft port. This is usually because another instance of the server is already running.

1. Open the Pterodactyl panel and navigate to the "Console" tab on the left sidebar.
2. Stop the server if it is currently running by entering the command "stop"
