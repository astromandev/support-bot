Error: Error: "Java Virtual Machine Was Not Found On Your System"

Solution: 1. First, you need to make sure that you have Java installed on your system. To check if you have Java installed, go to the Command Prompt or Terminal and type "java -version". If Java is not installed, install it from the official Java website.
2. Once you have installed Java, you need to set the Environment Variables. To do this, open the Control Panel and search for "Environment Variables."
