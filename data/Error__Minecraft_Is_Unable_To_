Error: Error: Minecraft Is Unable To Start Because It "Failed To Find An Accelerated OpenGL Mode".

Solution: 1. First thing you should try is to update your graphics driver to the latest version.
2. If the issue persists, try running Minecraft in compatibility mode for an older version of Windows, such as Windows 7 or 8.
3. If this doesn't work, you can try adding the following line to the JVM arguments in the Minecraft launcher: -Dorg.lwjgl.opengl.Display.allow
