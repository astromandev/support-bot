Error: Error: "Server Cannot Start: Failed To Bind To Port."

Solution: 1. Check if your firewall or antivirus is blocking the port. If so, unblock the port.
2. Make sure that no other application is using the same port. Change the port number in the server settings file, and restart the server.
3. If the error persists, check that the port is not restricted by your internet service provider (ISP). Consult your ISP or try a different port.
4. Double-check
