Error: Error: "Server Completely Unresponsive"

Cause: This Can Happen When The Minecraft Server Crashes And Fails To Restart Properly. It Can Also Happen If The Server Is Using Too Many Resources Or If There Is A Problem With The Server'S Configuration.

Solution: 1. Log into your Pterodactyl panel and go to the "Console" tab.
2. Check if the server is still running or if it has crashed. If it has crashed, try restarting the server using the "Restart" button
