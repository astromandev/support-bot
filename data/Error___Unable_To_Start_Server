Error: Error: "Unable To Start Server: The Server Must Be Started As The User That Owns The Server Files."

Solution: 1. Open up the Pterodactyl panel and go to the "Console" tab for the server in question.
2. Type the command "ls -l" to list the files in the server's directories and their owners.
3. Look for the server's main JAR file and note the owner. It should be the same as the username you used to create
