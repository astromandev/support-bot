Error: Error:
The Server Console Continues To Show "Server Stopped" Status Even After Restarting The Server Through The Pterodactyl Panel.

Solution: 1. Log in to your Pterodactyl panel account and navigate to the "Console" tab.
2. Check the status of the server. If it shows "stopped," try restarting it by typing the "restart" command.
3. If the server still doesn't start, try stopping it using the "stop" command and then start it
