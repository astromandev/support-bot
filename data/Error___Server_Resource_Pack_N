Error: Error: "Server Resource Pack Not Working In Pterodactyl Panel"

Solution: 1. Check that the resource pack is properly installed on the panel by going to the "Server Settings."
2. Verify that the resource pack is not corrupted or is missing files by using a separate Minecraft client.
3. Check the server logs for any errors related to the resource pack.
4. If the resource pack is not being properly applied, try re-uploading it to the panel and restarting the server.
