Error: Minecraft Server Error: "Unable To Access Jarfile"

Solution: 1. Check the file path of your Minecraft server jar file to ensure that it is accurately entered in the start.bat file.
2. Make sure that the server.jar file is named correctly and matches the file name in the start.bat file.
3. If you are running the server on a Linux or Mac machine, be sure to give the start.sh file executable permissions using the chmod command.
4. Check your firewall and antivirus settings
