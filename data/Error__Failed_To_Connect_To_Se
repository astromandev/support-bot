Error: Error: Failed To Connect To Server: Connection Refused

Solution: 1. Check if the server is running. You can do this by going to the Pterodactyl panel and checking the server status.
2. Check if the server IP and port are correct. The default port for Minecraft is 25565, but some servers may have a custom port.
3. Check if the server firewall is blocking the connection. You can check this by temporarily disabling the firewall or adding an exception for Minecraft
