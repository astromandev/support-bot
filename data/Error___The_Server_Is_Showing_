Error: Error: "The Server Is Showing As Online, But I Can'T Connect To It."

Solution: 1. Check your server's status page to see if there are any known issues or updates that may be impacting connectivity.

2. Ensure that your server's firewall settings aren't blocking incoming connections. If you're unsure how to check this, contact your hosting provider for assistance.

3. Check that your Minecraft client is running the same version as your server. Mismatched versions can cause connection issues.
