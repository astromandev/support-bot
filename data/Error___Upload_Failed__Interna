Error: Error: "Upload Failed: Internal Server Error" When Trying To Upload A Custom Minecraft Server Jar On A Pterodactyl Panel.

Solution: 1. Verify if the custom server jar file is valid and not corrupted.
2. Double-check that the jar file has the correct file extension (.jar) and not any other file extension such as .zip, .rar, etc.
3. Make sure that the jar file is not too large and does not exceed the allotted disk space for the server
