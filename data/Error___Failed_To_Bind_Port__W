Error: Error: "Failed To Bind Port" While Starting A Minecraft Server On Pterodactyl Panel.

Solution: 1. Check if the port you are using is being used by another process. To do this, open the Command Prompt or Terminal and enter the following command:
   `netstat -aon | findstr :[port_number]`
   Replace `[port_number]` with the port number you are trying to use. If you see a result, note the PID number as it
