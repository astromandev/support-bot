Error: Error: "Invalid Jarfile Error On Pterodactyl Panel While Setting Up A Minecraft Server"

Solution: 1. Firstly, check if the jar file you have uploaded is correct and working by uploading it again onto another server. You can also try re-downloading the server jar file.

2. Check if the file permission of the jar file is correct. Make sure that the file has correct chmod permission to run by executing the command "chmod +x filename.jar" in your server terminal.
