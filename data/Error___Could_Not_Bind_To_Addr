Error: Error: "Could Not Bind To Address 0.0.0.0:25565 - Address Already In Use"

Solution: 1. This error occurs when the Minecraft server port is already in use by another process on your server. To fix this, you'll need to free up the port.

2. First, you'll need to determine which application is currently using the port. To do this, open the terminal and run the following command: lsof -i :25565
