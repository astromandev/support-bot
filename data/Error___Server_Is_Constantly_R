Error: Error: "Server Is Constantly Restarting And Not Staying Online"

Solution: 1. Check the server logs for any errors or issues causing the restarts.
2. Ensure that the server system requirements are met.
3. Check if any plugins or mods are causing the restarts and remove them if necessary.
4. Make sure that the server's Java installation is up-to-date and compatible with the server.
