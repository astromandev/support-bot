Error: Minecraft Server Error: "Java.Net.BindException: Address Already In Use"

Solution: 1. This error message indicates that the port the Minecraft server is trying to use is already in use by another program. 

2. The first step is to try and identify which program is using the port. To do this, you can open the command prompt/terminal and type the command "netstat -aon". This will list all the active connections and the PID of the process using them.
