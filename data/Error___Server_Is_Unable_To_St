Error: Error: "Server Is Unable To Start And Displays An Error Message Saying: Error: Could Not Find Or Load Main Class -Xms512M."

Solution: 1. Log in to the Pterodactyl panel and navigate to the "Console" tab for the affected server.
2. Once logged in, go to the "Type here to send a command..." section and enter the following command: `jar -xf server.jar`. This will extract the jar file and create a new one.
