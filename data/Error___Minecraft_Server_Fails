Solution: 1. Check the amount of RAM allocated to the server in the Pterodactyl panel. Ensure that the amount of RAM allocated is within the limits of the server.

2. Verify that the server's Java path is correct in the panel, specifically for the server JAR file.

3. Try changing the Java version to a different version in the panel settings.
