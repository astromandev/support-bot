Error: Error: "Server Start Failed: Unable To Bind To Port"

Solution: 1. Check if the port the server is trying to bind to is in use by another application. To do this open the command prompt/terminal and type: netstat -ano | findstr :<port number>

2. If another application is using the port, close that application and try starting the server again.

3. If no other applications are using the port, check if the port is being blocked by your firewall
