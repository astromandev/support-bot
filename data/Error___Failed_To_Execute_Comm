Error: Error: "Failed To Execute Command 'Java' : No Such File Or Directory"

Solution: 1. This error usually occurs when the system cannot find the Java installation path or the path is not properly set.
2. First, check if Java is installed on your system or not by typing "java -version" command in the terminal.
3. If Java is not installed, install the latest version of Java using the following command:
   
  ```
   apt install default-jdk
  ```
