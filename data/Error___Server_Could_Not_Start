Error: Error: "Server Could Not Start. Are You Using The Correct Version? Server Stopped"

Solution: 1. Check if you have downloaded the correct version of the server software. Make sure that it matches the version you have selected in the Pterodactyl control panel. 

2. If you have already downloaded the correct version, then it is possible that there are missing required files in the server directory. Double-check your server files and make sure that all of the necessary files are present.
