Error: Error: "Invalid Response From Server: 503"

Solution: 1. Firstly, check if the server is running properly or not. If the server is not running, start it.
2. Ensure that your server's firewall or any software that you are using is not blocking the incoming and outgoing connections.
3. Verify if you have typed the correct server URL and port number.
4. If the issue still persists, try restarting the Pterodactyl panel service.
5. Check the logs
