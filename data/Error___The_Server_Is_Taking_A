Error: Error: "The Server Is Taking A Long Time To Start Up Or Crashed During Startup."

Solution: 1. Check the server logs for any errors or messages that indicate what is causing the issue. These logs are located in the "Console" section of the Pterodactyl panel.

2. If there are no obvious errors in the logs, try restarting the server to see if that resolves the issue.

3. If the server continues to have issues starting up, try creating a new server instance
