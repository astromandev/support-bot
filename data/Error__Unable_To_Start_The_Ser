Error: Error: Unable To Start The Server Due To A "Failed To Bind To Port" Error In Pterodactyl Panel.

Solution: 1. The first step is to check if the port is being used by another application. To do this, you can run the command 'netstat -an' in your terminal. You will see a list of all active connections and ports in use. Look for the port number your Minecraft server is using and check if it's being used by another application.
