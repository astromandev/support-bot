Error: "Server Not Starting After Importing A World On Pterodactyl Panel"

Solution: 1. First, ensure that you have uploaded the world files to the correct location on the server. You can check this by looking at the server's file manager in the Pterodactyl Panel.
2. Next, check that the server's configuration matches the world you have uploaded. Verify that the world name in the configuration file matches the name of the world directory you uploaded.
