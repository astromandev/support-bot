Error: Error: Failed To Verify Username (Server)

Solution: 1. Double-check your username and password to make sure they are correct.
2. Make sure that your internet connection is stable and fast enough to connect to a Minecraft server. Slow or unstable connections can cause authentication errors.
3. If you are using a third-party launcher, try using the official Minecraft launcher instead. Third-party launchers sometimes have compatibility issues with Minecraft's authentication system.
4. Make sure that your game client is up-to-date
