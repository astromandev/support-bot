Solution: 1. First, try logging out and back in to the Minecraft launcher.

2. If that doesn't work, delete your Minecraft launcher profile and create a new one. To do this, click on the "Launcher Options" button in the launcher, then click "Add New" under "Profiles". Give the new profile a name and select the version you want to play.

3. If you're still having trouble, clear the game cache
