Error: New Error: "Server Not Starting - Failed To Bind To Port 25565 Error"

Solution: 1. Make sure that no other programs or applications are using port 25565. This can be checked by running the command "netstat -ano | findstr :25565" in Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac or Linux).
2. If another program is using that port, change your Minecraft server's port number to an unused port by editing the server.properties file.
3.
