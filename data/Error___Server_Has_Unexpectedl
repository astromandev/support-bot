Error: Error: "Server Has Unexpectedly Stopped"

Solution: 1. First, log in to your Pterodactyl Panel and open the "Console" tab.
2. Check the output in the console to see if there are any error messages or warnings.
3. If there are no error messages, try restarting your server by clicking the "Restart" button.
4. If the server continues to unexpectedly stop, try changing the server's JAR file to a different version or a different modpack
