Error: Error: "The Server Is Running, But I Can'T Join It. I Get A 'Connection Refused' Error When Attempting To Connect."

Step-By-Step

Solution: 1. Check that the server is actually running by logging into the Pterodactyl panel and checking its status.
2. Ensure that the server is set up to allow outside connections by editing the server's firewall settings if needed. 
3. Check that the server's port is open in your router's firewall settings.
