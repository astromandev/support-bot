Solution: 1. Check that your server is running by logging into your Pterodactyl panel
2. Check that your IP address and port are set up correctly in the server configuration
3. If using a firewall, ensure that the Minecraft port (default is 25565) is open
4. Check that your internet connection is stable and that your ISP is not blocking the connection
5. Try restarting your server and router
