Error: Error: Unable To Allocate Enough Memory To Minecraft Server.

Solution: 1. Login to your Pterodactyl panel and click on "File Manager" from the server's dashboard.
2. Open the "server.properties" file and search for "Xmx" option.
3. Increase the value of "Xmx" option to allocate more memory. For example, set it to "-Xmx2G" to allocate 2GB memory to your server.
